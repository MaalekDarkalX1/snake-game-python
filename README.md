Snake Game (Python + Turtle)
This is a modern version of the classic Snake game created entirely in Python using the Turtle graphics library. It features a clean menu interface with clickable buttons and includes both Single Player and Multiplayer modes. Players control snakes that grow longer each time they eat food, while avoiding collisions with walls, themselves, or each other.
